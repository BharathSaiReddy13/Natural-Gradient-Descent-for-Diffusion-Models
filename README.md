## Overview

This project investigates the use of **Natural Gradient Descent (NGD)** for training **diffusion models**, a state-of-the-art framework in generative modeling. By incorporating information geometry through NGD, the goal is to achieve:

- Faster and more stable convergence during training  
- Improved sample quality in generative outputs  
- Scalable optimization methods tailored for diffusion-based architectures  

Diffusion models rely on a forward noise process and a learned reverse denoising process to generate high-dimensional data (e.g., images) from noise. While powerful, they are **computationally expensive** and highly sensitive to optimizer choice. NGD leverages the **Fisher Information Matrix** to guide updates, offering a principled alternative to standard optimizers such as SGD and Adam.

## Why This Matters

- **Efficiency Challenge:** Training diffusion models is resource-intensive and slow.  
- **Optimization Gap:** Existing optimizers often struggle with stability and generalization.  
- **Research Contribution:** NGD provides a geometry-aware approach that could unlock **faster training** and **higher-quality generations** in diffusion frameworks.
